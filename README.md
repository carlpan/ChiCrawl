# ChiCrawl
Project Goal

Yelp can provide recommendations for a specific location and Google Maps can provide directions, but if you want to visit multiple 
bars or you want to compare bars near you, there is no feature that can recommend an optimized itinerary that accounts for your drinking 
preferences while minimizing walking time between bars. Our goal of the project is to create a web-based application which allows users 
to acquire information on Chicago nightlife by integrating the functionality of Google map and Yelp to create a more personal-oriented
application. More specifically, we would like to make a bar crawl generator with an interactive map along with the informations of bars 
and drinks based on user-entered preferences.

Description of functionalities

1. User enter preferences in the form fields
2. After submitted, scroll down for results
3. If results returned, user can click on the list of bars to get map route display, user can also specify travel mode, and show all bar locations.
